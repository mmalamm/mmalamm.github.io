# Deuces

Deuces is a game based on a popular Chinese card game called Big Two (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two).

Big Two was designed and coded using Object Oriented Programming, and follows a loose implementation of the Observer Pattern by using Redux and RxJS for the game's logic progression and React for the user interface.
