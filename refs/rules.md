Deuces rules

- Deuces is a ‘shedding’ style card game, meaning the player who gets rid of all their cards first wins

- The card values from weakest to strongest are: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A, 2
- The card suits from weakest to strongest are: Diamonds, Clovers, Hearts, Spades

- We play with four players and we split the deck evenly: 13 cards per player
- Players may play singles, doubles, triples, or a poker hand
- Poker hands include the following (in order of weakest to strongest):
    - Straight: five cards of sequential value, with the strength determined by the strongest card
    - Flush: five cards of all the same suit, with the strength determined by the strongest card
    - House: a triple and a double, with the strength determined by the triple
    - Bomb: four of a kind plus a single, with the strength determined by the single
    - Royal Flush: a hand that is both a straight and a flush, with the strength determined by the strongest card

- The player with the three of diamonds goes first, deciding what type of hand players will play for the first round
- If the first player played a single, then all players must play singles for the rest of the round. Same with doubles, triples and poker hands
- A player may pass their turn if they cannot or do not want to play any cards
- A round is over when all other players pass on a turn, and the winner of the round decides what type of turn to play next

- The game is over a player is out of cards, and that player is awarded a point for each card left in the game, and the losers are charged a point for each card left in their hands
